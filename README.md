## Things to include on the website

Nominal effective exchange rate
The weighted average exchange rate of the rand is based on trade in and consumption of manufactured goods between South Africa and its most important trading partners. The methodology applied is described in an article in the June 2020 Quarterly Bulletin. As from 1 January 2015, the weighted average exchange rate of the rand is calculated against twenty currencies. The weights of the five major currencies are in brackets: Euro (30,68), Chinese yuan (24,53), US dollar (10,56), Japanese yen (4,95), Indian rupee (4,85). Index: 2015=100
